Each note may have several tags attached to it for reference. Clicking this tag will show similar notes which also have this tag. 

Search system which currently supports searching for the note title, and note text. 

Supports the ability for users to create an account which is only associated with the notes that they create. 

User can change password and customize the color of the tags in the user options page. Now includes the option for the user to chose in what order the notes should be displayed. This can currently be oldest first, newest first, A-Z, or Z-A.
