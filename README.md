# Note Keeper
Note keeping system which allows for the creating, updating and deleting of notes. 

Each note may have several tags attached to it for reference. Clicking this tag will show similar notes which also have this tag. 

Search system - currently supports searching for the note title. 

Also has user accounts, with both register and login page, only showing the notes of the logged in user. 

User can change password and customize the color of the tags in the user options page. 

Has now been updated to return the JSON, rather than the full HTML, for each note which is then built client-side. This will allow the potential use of AngularJS in the future.
