# Note Keeper
Note keeping system which allows for the creating, updating and deleting of notes.

Each note may have several tags attached to it for reference. Clicking this tag will show similar notes which also have this tag. 

Search system which currently supports searching for the note title. 

Supports the ability for users to create an account which is only associated with the notes that they create. 

User can change password and customize the color of the tags in the user options page - further options are to be added.

Currently implementing email confirmation on sign-up.

Has now been updated to return the JSON, rather than the full HTML, for each note which is then built client-side. This will allow the potential use of AngularJS in the future.
