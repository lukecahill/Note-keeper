//Notifications which could be shown in the bottom corner of the page, and also dismissed.
//This would require another table with system information which can be marked read? Or something like this. It would be best to have it in the account page. 
//Display a header with information? This can be dismissed and stored using local storage? Or maybe using a number to show the most recently read/dismissed notification and would only show higher numbers.

//One of these approaches above could be used. 

//Start this tomorrow cba rn.
